# C++ Simple Calculator

This is a small C++ practice project that implements a simple calculator using classes and basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Purpose
This project is designed for practicing C++ syntax, class structure, and basic operations. 

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)

## File Structure
- `calculator.h`: Declaration of the Calculator class and its methods
- `calculator.cpp`: Implementation of the methods
- `main.cpp`: Main programme file for user interaction and invoking the calculator functions

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Input numbers and select an operation.

## Future Improvements
- Add more operations like modulus, exponentiation, and so on
- Add handling decimal values
- Implement a user-friendly interface
